<h1>Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time by Perry Fontana</h2>
<hr>

<h3>1. Deadpool</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie as Ryan Reynolds hilariously brings the 
   comic book character to life, with perfect comedic timing. I would
highly reccomend to anyone looking for a laugh or wanting to cheer 
cheer themselves up, this is the perfect movie.</p>

<h3>2. Crows Zero</h3>
<p>This is a movie based on the anime of the same name and is set in
    a school of delinquent and violent students who want to raise to the 
    top of the school by fighting. A new student who is aiming to become
    the head of his fathers yakuza family joins the school as he is unable
    to achieve this he has to become the top of the school. It stars Shun Oguri
    and Takayuki Yamada as the main protagonists and is an action packed thriller.

<h3>3. The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>I am not usually a fan of christmas movies however this dark take on the festive season 
    is highly entertaining and filled with catchy music from Danny Elfman(Creator of The Simpsons theme song). In this movie,
    you can see classic stop motion animation at work which was revolutionary at the time. I would highly reccomend this for the 
    Christmas season.
