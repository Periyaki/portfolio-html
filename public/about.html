<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After 6 years working in Logistics and deciding that I needed a change, I developed a passion for web development and coding
  to persue as a new career. After only coding for a few months, I have been able to develop two HTML webpage projects, one Birthday 
  Party Invite webpage and A movie ranking webpage.</p>

<p>Based in London, UK, I will be creating dynamic, eye catching webpages for various companies, brands and will also be developing various
  language learning applications so stay tuned!</p>
